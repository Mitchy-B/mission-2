                <h1>Welcome to Banksy Dives Aotearoa</h1>
                <h3>If you have come looking for advice on where to dive, where to learn, where to find weather conditions or just to chat about diving, you've come to the right place!</h3></div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Dive Locations</h2>
                    <h3>Aotearoa is a wonderful country for diving, due to its wide variety of sea-life, artificial reefs and natural beautiful locations.</h3>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h3>Mathesons Bay</h3>
                        
                        <p>Located an hour and a half north of Auckland CBD in the small coastal town of Leigh, this dive location has A large rock Island and smaller rocky formations just a short swim out off the shore, teaming with Snapper, Wrasse, Kina, Rays, and has even been known to have Orcas chase Rays right into the bay.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Goat Island</h3>
                        <p>Not far from Mathesons bay, we have the Goat Island Marine Reserve. Because the area is protected, the marine life flourishes. Prepare to see some big nosy Snapper, as well as some big Crayfish! But remember, as delicious as they look, the are is protected, so leave nothing but bubbles.</p>
                       

                        <h3>HMNZS Canterbury</h3>
                        <p>THe HMNZS Canterbury is a decommissioned NZ Navy Frigate, scuttled in Deep Water Cove as an artificial reef, to help encourage depleted fish stocks to increase. It is easiest to access by boat, with Te Uenga Bay being the closest place to launch from, and is a sandy beach. Otherwise Paihia is about 16km away by boat. There is a Rahui in place to protect fish stocks, and this makes for cool sea life to be seen around and throughout the ship. Because of it being in a sheltered cove, the ship is well preserved and is easily one of my favourite dive spots.</p>
